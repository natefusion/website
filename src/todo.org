instead of a build folder, put the results back into the src folder
rename all my files to end with a .frag.html

the compiler will remove the .frag for me

maybe commit the files generated by compile.py
I would have to run the build step before commmiting changes
The benefit would be not needing to run a build step on the server
this gives me flexibility (I could use github pages for example)
it would also give me a truly static site
I could also rename my .frag files (which I edit) to be the same as the parent folder, the compiler can transform this into index.html for me (so that the filenames for all my things are more readable)
